## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in a SiMa.ai project:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**  
   Publicly disclosing a vulnerability before it is patched could put users at risk.

2. Instead, please report it privately by emailing:  
   **[support@sima.ai](mailto:support@sima.ai)**

3. Provide as much detail as possible:
   - Affected repository and version  
   - Environment details (hardware platform, OS, SDK version)  
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability  
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations  

---

## Response Process

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **5 business days**.  
- A maintainer will investigate and provide updates on the status of the issue.  
- Once resolved, we will release a security update and credit the reporter (if desired).  

---

## Scope

This policy applies to all repositories under the **[SiMa-ai GitHub organization](https://github.com/SiMa-ai)**, including:  
- System enablement projects (Yocto, drivers, SDK)  
- AI demos and pipelines (Vision, Voice, Language)
