# Neural Edge Acceleration Toolkit (NEAT)

<img src="./neat-logo.png" alt="NEAT Logo" width="50%" />

Build production-grade multimedia + ML pipelines without fighting pipeline complexity.

**SiMa NEAT** is a modern **C++20** library (with **Python bindings**) for building, validating, running, and debugging **GStreamer** pipelines through a stable, composable API.

**NEAT** stands for **Neural Edge Acceleration Toolkit**.

Our mission is simple: make the transition from Nvidia-based application stacks to SiMa as smooth as possible, while preserving the full power and flexibility of GStreamer.

## Why SiMa-NEAT?

GStreamer is powerful, but hand-authoring and maintaining complex pipelines can be brittle and hard to scale.

SiMa-NEAT gives you a higher-level **pipeline-as-code** workflow so teams can:

- Compose pipelines from reusable building blocks
- Validate configurations earlier and catch errors faster
- Run and debug pipelines with clear, structured interfaces
- Produce ML-friendly outputs (including tensors)
- Keep configurations reproducible across environments

## What You Get

- **C++20-first API** for performance-critical systems
- **Python API** for fast iteration and experimentation
- **Composable architecture** for maintainable pipeline design
- **Deterministic, reproducible configs** for reliable deployments
- **Developer-friendly debugging** for faster troubleshooting

## Documentation

Official docs: **https://neat.modalix.info**

## Organization Focus

This organization manages all things related to **NEAT**:

- Core library development
- Python bindings
- Integration examples
- Tooling and workflow support
- Documentation and best practices

## Vision

SiMa-NEAT is built for teams who need both:

- The low-level power of GStreamer
- A clean, scalable developer experience for modern ML/video systems

If your pipeline stack is growing in complexity, SiMa-NEAT is designed to help you move faster with confidence.
